Reddit Client
===============================================================================

A basic Reddit client used to quickly browse Reddit using it's JSON API and
caching. It even has a few topics (carefully selected by me) to browse. There's
not much to this, but it's pretty neat I guess.

## Features:

* Browse Reddit and view each posts along with their stats.
* Clicking a post will link you straight to the page.
* View the feed of a set of select subreddits.
* Add new subreddits to browse.

## Commands:

| Command       | Description                           |
